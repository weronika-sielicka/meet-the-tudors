# meet-the-tudors

Can be viewed at www.meet-the-tudors.github.io

Single Page Application created with HTML, Sass, a dash of Bootstrap and ReactJS.

On the homepage the main attraction are the portraits of Tudor dynasty members arranged to resemble a family tree.

Upon clicking on a portrait information about the person in the portrait shows up.

The painting at the top of the page doubles as a link (leads to the webpage about this painting).

In the Films section you can view documentaries about the Tudors (thanks to the use of YouTube API), 

and in the About section you can read a bit about the page and me.

The goal is to make this page as responsive as possible, it is still a work in progress.

The website focuses on the Tudor dynasty as I am interested in the history of England, particularly the Tudor period.
